#  BASH-Github-Demo-2022

A Practical Github demo for BASH Fall 2022

## A little bit about Markdown
- it's *really* easy
- it's readable and editable **directly** in github
- you can link [whatever websites you want](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/)

you can also make it highlight code!

```python
def burris_python(x):
  print('the big {}'.format(x))
  
burris_python('squeeze')
```
```
the big squeeze
```

**this** is professional grade
